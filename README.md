This is the WebXR + A-Frame Workshop.  To use it, get a copy of these files on your local machine, or better yet
a server hosting service like Glitch.  The workshop has three parts. Each part contains
instructions, start.html, and end.html. The ending html is what your code should look like
after you have completed that section.

* Section 1: converting a VR scene to an AR scene
* Section 2: adding simple interaction based on movement
* Section 3: adding physics and complex interaction based on clicks and taps
